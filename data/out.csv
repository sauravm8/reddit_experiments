24,"In a room of 23 people, there’s a better-than-50% chance that two people have the same birthday.","It's called the Birthday Paradox. Here's an explanation from our friends at Business Insider.

""If two people are in a room together, then there's a 364/365 chance they do not have the same birthday (if we ignore leap years and assume that all birthdays are equally likely), since there are 364 days that are different from the first person's birthday that can then be the second person's birthday.

If there are three people in the room, then the probability that they all have different birthdays is 364/365 x 363/365: As above, once we know the first person's birthday, there are 364 choices of different birthday for the second person, and this leaves 363 choices for the third person's birthday that are different from those two.

Continuing in this fashion, once you hit 23 people, the probability that all 23 have different birthdays drops below 50%, and so the probability that at least two have the same birthday is better than even.""

75,This Is Why Bananas Are Curved!," [https://bestlifeonline.com/this-is-why-bananas-are-curved/](https://bestlifeonline.com/this-is-why-bananas-are-curved/) 

&#x200B;

 

Bananas: a great source of potassium, an excellent source of vitamins, and—as everyone knows—the most recognizable fruit on the planet. After all, you don't come across many fruits that look like crescent moons. (Or… Um… Something else.) Moreover, not every banana is the same. Some are more curved, some are less.

What's the deal?

Well, [according to the experts at Dole](https://www.dole.eu/dole-earth/farmtour/bananito/hotspot/banana-curved.html), who are known for their fruit—and, in particular, their bananas—the reason is nothing short of poetic.

Bananas go through a process that's scientifically called ""negative geotropism."" What that means, in layman's terms, is that as bananas grow, they become too heavy for the plant, and start sinking towards the ground. So the curve in the banana is due to the fruit's dogged pursuit of the rays of sun. Yes, the banana is actually curling up against its own weight, much like you would do in a Pilates class, in an effort to get more sunlight.

The reasoning for this actually has to do with where the bananas originated: the rainforest, where there is notoriously little sunlight. So, the banana adapted, evolved, and survived.

Per Dole, ""If the fruit were to grow towards the small amount of light that penetrates sideways through the vegetation, the plant could overbalance and topple over. So bananas developed a way of growing towards the light without destabilising the plant.""",f4le2j,1,34,34,0

78,Excited Utterance,"This is quite the random fact, but also very important to know. If ever you are attacked and are killed due to the actions of another, you MUST acknowledge (if you are able to prior to passing away) verbally that you are dying before making any other statement (in regards to knowing who killed you) or else that statement will not be admissible in court as the court recognizes those statements as Excited Utterances. 

     An excited utterance is a statement made directly following or in quick succession of a traumatic or startling event. These are not admissible in court due to the court considering them statements made by an unstable and confused/excited mindset, untrustworthy. If you begin your statement with the acknowledgement that you are dying, it has a better chance of being considered that you were of sound mind when stated. 

     In conclusion, to insure that the person(s) who attack you and kill you go to jail, make sure you verbally acknowledge the physical state you are in before making any other statements.

170,Strange Facts You’ve Probably Never Heard Before | 4KingMedia,"We live in a pretty strange and interesting world. The sheer amount of information out there feels insurmountable, and sometimes it feels like you’ll never know it all - you definitely won’t. Still, here are some strange facts you’ve probably never heard before.

**10. The longest time between twins being born is 87 days** 

On average, the time between twin births is 17 minutes. Once the first baby is out, the second one is birthed much more easily (unless it’s in breach). In a very unusual case, twin babies were born a whopping 87 days apart. Maria Jones-Elliott went into labour four months early, giving birth to one of her twins, Amy, prematurely. 87 days later, Katie arrived. The births have since become a Guinness World Record for “the longest interval between the birth of twins,” beating the previous record of 84 days. 

**9. Northern Leopard Frog** 

On the more gruesome side of things, the Northern Leopard Frog swallows its prey using its [eyes](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/8/1361.abstract). It uses them to help push food down, but retracting them into its head. There’s an entire paper that’s been published about this, but really it’s just kind of gross. 

**8. Dance Fever**

Not to be mistaken with Saturday Night Fever with John Travolta, the [Dance Fever](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7608000/7608874.stm) of 1518 was a month-long plague of inexplicable dancing in Strasbourg. While historians aren’t entirely sure what caused it, it was likely the result of mass hysteria. Hundreds of people danced for about a month for no real reason, with several actually dancing themselves to death. 

 **7. Sigurd the Mighty** 

Sigurd the Mighty, a ninth-century Norse earl, was killed by a man he had murdered hours prior. He’d beheaded the man, and then tied the head to his horse’s saddle. While riding home, one of its teeth grazed open his leg. He later died from an infection. Talk about revenge! 

**6. Blue family group** 

The Fulgates of Troublesome Creek, a family with blue skin, lived in Kentucky for generations. They’re thought to have gained their blue skin via inbreeding and a rare genetic condition called methemoglobinemia. Most recently, Benjamin Stacy, born in 1975, frightened doctors with the shocking blue hue of his skin at his birth. He died in 1985.

**5. Running out of time** 

Earthquakes with extremely high magnitudes can permanently shorten the length of Earth’s day. By moving the spin of the Earth’s axis, the 2011 Japan earthquake took 1.8 microseconds off of our days. The 2004 Sumatra earthquake knocked off 6.8 microseconds. 

**4. Struck by lightning** 

Roy C. Sullivan, a U.S park ranger, holds the record for being struck by lightning the most times. He was struck, and survived, lighting strikes a whopping 7 times between 1942 and 1977. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1983. 

**3. Longest musical performance** 

The longest musical performance is currently underway in the church of St. Burchardi in Halberstadt, Germany. The performance of John Cage’s [""Organ²/ASLSP (As Slow As Possible)""](http://www.aslsp.org/de/), started in 2001, and is set to finish in 2640. The last time the note changed was in 2013, with the next change due sometime in 2020. 

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwnUhXhg5V8**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwnUhXhg5V8) 

**2. More mass hysteria** 

A laughing epidemic that lasted nearly a year broke out in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in 1962. Thousands of people were affected, with the epidemic spanning across several villages and even forcing a school to close. Apparently it wasn’t all that much fun though, with other symptoms including crying, pain, rashes, and fainting. 

1. **Brendan O’Smarty** 

This might not be the strangest item on the list of strange facts you’ve probably never heard before,  but it’s definitely the funniest. In 1993, San Francisco held a referendum over whether Bob Geary, a SF police officer, could patrol while carrying - get this - his ventriloquist’s dummy. Brendan O’Smarty was the dummy, and boy did he make a fine police officer. Yes, there really was an official referendum for this. The outcome? He could. 

**Strangest facts**

From blue people, to ventriloquist’s dummies, the world is full of some pretty bizarre things. This might not be a comprehensive list of strange facts you’ve probably never heard before, but hopefully you learned something.

December 25th corresponds directly to the Roman pagan celebration, Saturnalia.

264,Flammable and inflammable mean the same thing.,"Inflammable and flammable are two words that are frequently misinterpreted. Some people mistake the words as having opposite meanings. In reality, flammable and inflammable mean exactly the same thing— easily set on fire.

Inflammable is derived from the word inflame (sometimes spelled enflame), and precedes the invention of the word flammable. The first syllable, in, is often confused for the negative prefix in- which is like the latin prefix un- (see: inconspicuous, inescapable, indestructible, etc…). The in- prefix in the case of inflammable is derived from the Latin prefix en-, meaning “to cause (a person or thing) to be in” (like enslave, encourage, etc…).

Edit-- 

With all this confusion behind the definition of the word inflammable, the National Fire Protection Association urged Americans in the 1920s to start using the word flammable to avoid confusion and prevent fires because they thought people may mistake inflammable as meaning not being able to burn.

The word flammable eventually became part of the common vernacular, but a lot of confusion still remains today. So always remember that inflammable means exactly the same thing as flammable—it could save your life.

On 17 April 1651, a letter in Whitelocke’s Memorials states, “Tromp came to Pendennis and related that he had been to Scilly to demand reparation for the Dutch ships and goods taken by them; and receiving no satisfactory answer, he had, according to his Commission, declared war on them.” Soon after the declaration of war on 17 April 1651, Parliamentarian forces forced the Royalists to surrender and the Netherlands left the Isles of Scilly without firing a shot. Because the “war” itself was dubious–involving a small port, no armed conflict, and an obscure objective–no nation officially declared peace.

The Netherlands and the Isles largely forgot about the “war” and carried on with their respective foreign interests. Though they were not actively engaged in conflict, they were still technically at war because no treaty had ever been signed between the two combatants.

312,There was once a man who ate a 15 person feast on his own. In a single sitting.,"According to multiple sources, (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrare) there was once a man named Terrare. (Terare, Tarare) He was a French man who had an INSANE ability to eat. Not even an ability, more of a curse really. By 14 he could eat a whole quarter of a cow on his own. His poor farmer parents couldn't afford him anymore so they kicked him out. He began doing street acts to get food. He eventually ended up joining the French military. With his HUGE hunger, military rations just weren't doing it for him, so he dug through the trash and ate anything he could find. Eventually, he passed out due to exhaustion because he couldn't get enough food. So with him hospitalized, the French decided to do some experiments on his superhuman anatomy, including leaving him in a room with a FIFTEEN PERSON FEAST. He ate all of it. In one sitting. Apparently, he STILL couldn't get enough and was caught eating dead bodies from the morgue. Everything was going okay for him until one day, there was a missing baby, 14 months old. As it turns out, good ol' Terrare had a midnight snack. He was kicked out of the hospital and, after four years, turned up at Versailles, had a bout of explosive diarrhea, went to the hospital, and died.",e5t98h,6,25,25,0

389,Traveling to the past is way more complicated than traveling to the future.,"Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time. Time travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal ""flow"" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) ""persist"" in some way. If it is necessarily true that the past happened in a certain way, then it is false and impossible for the past to have occurred in any other way. A time traveller would not be able to change the past from the way it is. Anything a time traveller does in the past must have been part of history all along, and the time traveller can never do anything to prevent the trip back in time from happening, since this would represent an inconsistency. probability bends to prevent paradoxes from occurring. Outcomes would become stranger as one approaches a forbidden act, as the universe must favor improbable events to prevent impossible ones. Also Epstein did not kill himself.

461,Casu Marzu cheese is purposely infested with maggots.," 

If you ever come across maggot-infested food (yuck!), the best course of action is usually to throw the item into the trash as quickly as possible. However, those who make Casu Marzu cheese welcome the fly larva. With a name that literally translates to ""rotten cheese,"" the Sardinian delicacy starts as Pecorino Sardo. But, instead of being soaked in brine, it's left out so that Piophila casei cheese flies can lay their eggs inside of it. The larva eventually hatches from the eggs and eats [the cheese](https://bestlifeonline.com/cheese-puns/), which produces enzymes that lead to fermentation and decomposition in what will become the Casu Marzu.

[*I Love Cheese*](http://www.ilovecheese.co.uk/casu-marzu-worlds-dangerous-cheese.html) describes it by saying that it's a ""highly pungent, super soft cheese that oozes tears ('lagrima'), and fittingly so, as it tends to burn on the tongue.""

That's because, in 1950, it was discovered that bodies in the local cemetery in Longyearbyen were not decomposing as usual because there was so much permafrost in the area. That meant that viruses could survive in the human remains and eventually infect those living nearby when the ground thawed each year.

479,The very quickly googled facts about sleep paralysis. TL;DR you brain dosent wake all the way so movement is controlled by the subconscious (so not) and breathing is controlled by the consciousness and then the subconsciousness stops filtering bad things,"TL;DR you brain dosent wake all the way so movement is controlled by the subconscious (so not) and breathing is controlled by the consciousness and then the subconsciousness stops filtering bad things

Okay so. In sleep paralysis you brain thinks its awake while keeping the movement part of itself asleep. So, while sleeping you subconscious filters out all your thoughts from interfering with sleep. It first filters bad thoughts and then all the rest. Sometimes the subconscious cant handle all the thoughts so it leaks some through (eg dreams) some brains are better filters or just dont think enough. Anyway. Once you wake up normally your first thought is either, move or slouch. Well, if you wake in a sleep paralysis your first thought is ""breath"" because, according to Wikipedia, you stop breathing for 1 min+ before waking in a paralysis state. Anyway, the reason this happens is because your main conscious is focusing on breathing hence why dreamers tend t ok breath slower, so when you wake in a paralysis your conscious is still doing its thing. Then at that same time when you conscious and subconscious start switching levels (while awake con is above sub then sleep is vice versa) the sub goes to the normal things it be doing, breathing n stuff, so its stops filtering bad thought like ""what if there is an 8 foot dude in my hallway?"" And just shows you it, hence whey you have ""sleep paralysis demons"" . So even after all of that, why cant you move? Because the movement, since not immediately being taken over by consciousness it remains under sub until you wake up normally.

528,Youngest Person To Be Sentenced To Death In The United States,"
George stinney Jr of African descent, was the youngest person to be sentenced to death in the United States

He was only 14 years old when he was executed in an electric chair.

During his trial he always carried a Bible in his hands claiming his innocence.

He was accused of killing two white girls, 11 year old Betty and Mary of 7,

The bodies were found near the house of the boy in which he lived with his parents.

At that time, all members of the jury were whites.

The trial lasted for 2 hours only and the sentence was dictated 10 minutes later.

The boy's parents were threatened and prevented from being present in the court room, and subsequently expelled from that city.

Before the execution George spent 81 days in prison without being able to see his parents, he was held in solitary 80 miles from his city, he was held alone without anybody to talk to.

He was electrocuted with 5380 VOLTS IN HIS HEAD, imagine all that amount of voltage in a teenager's head.

563,"The whole Universe, if not infinite, is probably so large that the unit used to express its size becomes totally irrelevant.","The size of the visible Universe is well known. But what about the site of the whole universe ? To this day we don't know whether it's finite in size or infinite. But if it's finite, its size is probably mindblowing. Let's assume it is 10 \^10000 (ten to the powers of ten thousands)  light-years in diameter, which is far below some higher estimates, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Size_and_regions).

Of course it's not EXACTLY 10 \^ 10000 lightyears in diameters, so lets assume we have a +/- 5% precision, which is much preciser than our knowledge of the size of our own Galaxy... So the size of the Universe would be between 10 \^ 9500 and 10 \^10500 light-years. Fine. But why using light-years ?

What if we use meters instead ? It might seem odd to measure the universe in meters, but the numbers we're talking about are somewhat odd too... A light-year is approximately 10 \^15 meters. So all we have to do to convert the size in light-years to meters is add 15 to the number of powers... the Universe is then between 10 \^ 9515 and  10 \^ 10515 meters in diameter.... Doesn't change that much eh ?

What if we go extreme ? The smallest possible unit is the Planck length, which is grossly 10 \^ -35 meters, and the largest unit I can think of would be the yottaparsec, which is grossly 10 \^ 39 meters.

So the size of the universe is between 10 \^ 9480 and 10 \^ 10480 Planck lengths, or between 10 \^ 9544 and 10 \^ 10544 yottaparsecs.

We see that the difference in size induced by the 5% precision of the measure of much bigger than the difference in size induced by the unit choice. So we can quite safely assume than IF we were able to know how big the whole universe is, for the 1st time we could express a size without using any unit, because that would just be irrelevant :)",d0vzrs,2,20,20,0

If one of their legs move separately then the penis and balls tangle, which is equivalent to testicular torsion of the human race. Since kangaroos don't have access to emergency services like a hospital, they cannot risk losing their penis. This is the reason that kangaroos will only jump to move.",d0mcop,4,25,25,0

569,Some myths about Air Conditioners,"People are always seeking ways to use energy more efficiently with the intent of saving money on utilities and minimizing their carbon footprint. But along the way, certain ideas have emerged about how people think they ought to use their air conditioner, versus how the air conditioner works. These are the main AC myths many of us fall susceptible to!

# Myth #1: Using a low set-point temperature will decrease humidity similar to Dry Mode

Air conditioners consume energy at a rate that is based on outdoor temperature and relative humidity. However, the way AC remotes are designed often causes us to fixate on the temperature and “Power” buttons alone, ignoring other modes.

Since we are very sensitive to humidity and respond to moisture-heavy environments by sweating, we end up feeling even hotter. Sometimes it is more beneficial to use our AC on “Dry Mode” – an AC function that could be more energy efficient at extracting humidity from the room, when conditions are humid but not too hot – as it is essentially a weaker version of “Cool Mode”.

Using Dry Mode will cause the fan in your AC to operate at a slower speed, resulting in a cooler evaporator coil that condenses water vapor as the AC blows out the dry air through the appliance. This mode won’t completely dehumidify your home but it will reduce moisture and will also use less energy than the full “Power” or “Cool” modes.

# Myth #2: Setting your AC to a lower temperature will cool the room faster and more efficiently

Except inverter ACs, conventional units can only turn the compressor ‘on’ or ‘off’. So whether you set your AC for 23°C or 19°C, your AC will not work any faster to reach the lower temperature. A lower set-point temperature will eventually use more energy – and if you forget to re-adjust it, your AC will over-cool and be less efficient.

The smaller the difference between outdoor and indoor temperatures, the lower your overall energy bill will be.

# Myth #3: Keeping your air conditioner on all day will save more energy than turning it on/off

Some people believe that it’s more effective to leave your AC running all day, even when no one is around. Your AC consumes less power when completely turned off, as opposed to operating all day – even at a higher temperature.

3. Amazon has lost 20% of its size in recent years because of deforestation. A drastic amount of vegetation is cleared constantly for cattle grazing and crop production 1.5 acres are lost every second. Experts predict that the rainforest could be completely depleted in just 40 years if no action is taken to solve the problem.

677,"Female ants are 75% related to their sisters, 50% to their mothers and fathers, and 25% to their brothers","Source: The Behavioural Ecology of Ants (Sudd & Franks, 1987)

""under certain circumstances female Hymenoptera (which includes workers of ants, bees and wasps) could pass more copies of their genes into future generations by rearing sisters and brothers instead of their own sons and daughters. This possibility is in large part due to the unusual mechanism of sex determination in Hymenoptera. In this group females develop from fertilized and hence diploid eggs, with a set of chromosomes from their mother and from their father. Males are produced from unfertilized eggs and are therefore haploid, inheriting their single set of genes from their mother. All the sperm produced by a haploid male carry an identical set of genes. Thus female Hymenoptera with the same father and mother will have identical copies of genes in the half of their diploid genotype that they inherited from their father. This means that a very high proportion of the genes of hymenopteran sisters will be identical by common descent. On average, full sisters will have in common half ofthe genes from their mother and all the genes from their father. Since half of their total gene complement came from each parent, the average fraction of genes that sisters will have in common is given by (½×½+½) i.e. ¾""

""A gene present in a mother's genome has a 50% chance of occurring in anyone of her daughters or sons. However, since males do not have fathers and are haploid, all their sperm are alike. Therefore, full sisters have identical genes inherited from their father. This means that any gene present in a female has a 75% chance of being present in her full sister. Kin selection therefore favours the rearing of fertile sisters rather than daughters. By contrast a brother and sister, on average, will have only 25% of their genes in common by direct descent from their mother's genome.""",cqmi91,2,14,14,0

You calculate this (to Kilometers per hour) by multiplying 13mi by 1.609 which gives you 20.9215km (because 1 mile is 1.609 km's), you then calculate 30 minutes to 0.5h or half an hour by timesing 30 by 60 (because there's 60 minutes in an hour) which gives you 0.5h, so now you have the Distance and Time to get the speed
